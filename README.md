# ArduinoHourglass
10/04/2018 A little object that uses two 8x8 LED Matrix and a tilt switch to display time.
Code is commented in French. This is an image of the wiring i used, if the hourglass behaves with 'gravity' upside-down, try rotating the tilt switch ;)

## 19/03/2018  I have adapted the hourglass design to work as a chess/go game clock : 
Both opponents have the same amount of time at the beginning and when the hourglass is rotated, it switches between the time left for each of them.
The code works but hasn't been cleaned yet.
