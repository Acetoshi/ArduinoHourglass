# ArduinoHourglass
A little object that uses two 8x8 LED Matrix and a tilt switch to display time.

Code is commented in French.

19/03/2018  I have adapted the hourglass design to work as a chess/go game clock : 
Both opponents have the same amount of time at the beginning and when the hourglass is rotated, it switches between the time left for each of them.
